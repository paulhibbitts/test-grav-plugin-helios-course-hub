# Grav Helios Course Hub Plugin

Requires the [Grav Premium Helios theme](https://getgrav.org/premium/helios). Give your course a clean, open home on the web – without building from scratch. Designed for use with the pre-configured [Grav Helios Course Hub Skeleton](https://github.com/paulhibbitts/grav-skeleton-helios-course-hub), providing custom CSS, JavaScript, shortcodes and enhanced Admin Panel readability. [Grav](https://getgrav.org) is an open-source, flat-file CMS – no database required, with a built-in browser-based Admin panel.

## Who This Is For

The Helios Course Hub is a **course companion site** – a place to organise and share course content, resources, schedules, and weekly materials alongside your existing LMS (Canvas, Moodle, Brightspace, etc.). It is not a learning management system and does not include enrolment, grade tracking, or student progress features.

It is well suited for tech-curious or tech-savvy educators and teams, including:
- Individual educators wanting a clean, open companion site for one or more courses
- Teams hosting shared course content, reference guides, or topic indexes
- Anyone who prefers editing content in Markdown with full control over structure and hosting

## Quick Start

The recommended starting point is the pre-configured [Grav Helios Course Hub Skeleton](https://github.com/paulhibbitts/grav-skeleton-helios-course-hub/releases/latest), which includes this plugin, demo content, and all required configuration out of the box.

The skeleton defaults to a **single-course setup** – the top-level folders in `user/pages/` are pre-configured and ready to use.

To install the plugin manually, see the [Installation](#installation) and [Demo Content](#demo-content) sections below.

## Demo Content

The `_demo` folder contains a default Helios Course Hub site that can be used as a starting point. It includes two layouts:

**Single-course site** (`_demo/pages/`):
- `10.home/` – Course home page with weekly content cards
- `20.essentials/` – Essential course links and resources
- `30.modules/` – Weekly modules (Welcome + Modules 01–13), each with a header image
- `40.schedule/` – Course schedule
- `50.topics/` – Topics index
- `60.resources/` – Resource list
- `70.ux-techniques-guide/` – UX techniques reference guide
- `80.syllabus/` – Course syllabus
- `contact/` – Contact page
- `copyright/` – Copyright notice

**Multi-course site** (`_demo/pages/`):
- `00.home-multicourse/` – Course list home page using the `courselist` template
- `cpt-363-1/` – First course with the same section structure as the single-course layout
- `cpt-363-2/` – Second course with the same section structure as the single-course layout
- `cpt-363-3/` – Third course with the same section structure as the single-course layout

To use the demo content, copy the contents of `_demo/pages/` into your Grav `user/pages/` folder.

## Helios Theme Configuration

If you are not using the pre-configured [Grav Helios Course Hub Skeleton](https://github.com/paulhibbitts/grav-skeleton-helios-course-hub), add the following to `user/config/themes/helios.yaml` to configure course versioning and search:

```yaml
versioning:
  version_pattern: '/^[a-zA-Z]+-?\d+([.-]\d+)*$/i'
  labels:
    cpt-363-1: CPT-363-1
    cpt-363-2: CPT-363-2
    cpt-363-3: CPT-363-3
search:
  placeholder: 'Search course...'
```

## Installation

1. Copy the `helios-course-hub` folder into `user/plugins/`
2. The plugin is enabled by default via `helios-course-hub.yaml`

## Features

- Course List page template with auto-generated course cards
- Built-in shortcodes for embedding content (iFrames, Google Slides, PDFs, H5P, Embedly)
- Embedly card support with automatic dark/light theme detection
- Enhanced Admin Panel readability (increased font sizes, Editor Pro toolbar scaling)

- Overrides the Helios "Version" label to "Course" for multi-course setups
- Git Sync plugin included in the skeleton for syncing site content with a GitHub or GitLab repository

If you prefer not to write Markdown directly, the optional [Grav Premium Editor Pro](https://getgrav.org/premium/editor-pro) provides a visual block editor for editing pages.

## Shortcodes

- `[iframe url="..."]` – Responsive iframe embed, 16:9 by default
- `[iframe url="..." ratio="4:3"]` – Responsive iframe embed at 4:3 ratio
- `[googleslides url="..."]` – Responsive Google Slides embed, 16:9 by default
- `[googleslides url="..." ratio="4:3"]` – Responsive Google Slides embed at 4:3 ratio
- `[pdf url="..."]` – PDF viewer via Google Docs, 16:9 by default

- `[h5p url="..."]` – H5P interactive content via full embed URL
- `[h5p id="..."]` – H5P interactive content via Content ID (requires H5P Content Embed Source URL to be set in plugin settings)
- `[embedly url="..."]` – Embedly card with dark mode support
- `[topics]...[/topics]` – Alphabetical topics index with auto-generated A–Z navigation, linked letters, and styled letter section labels

### Topics Shortcode

The `[topics]` shortcode wraps alphabetically organised content and auto-generates a full A–Z index at the top of the page. Letters with entries are rendered as anchor links; letters without entries are shown as dimmed plain text.

```markdown
# Topics

[topics]
## A
[Agile UX](../modules/module-02)
## D
[Design Ethics](../modules/module-02)
[Design Thinking](../modules/module-01)
[/topics]
```

## Course List Page

The `courselist` page template automatically generates course cards from detected version folders. Each card displays a title, icon and description sourced from the course root folder's markdown file (e.g. `cpt-363-1/default.md`):

```yaml
---
title: CPT-363
icon: tabler/bulb.svg
description: A basic introduction to UI/UX design.
---
```

The number of cards per row can be set via `cards_per_row` (1–4) in the course list page frontmatter.

## Multi-Course Folder Naming

Course folders must start with one or more letters followed by a number. An optional hyphen can separate letters from the number, and additional version segments (separated by dots or hyphens) are supported.

**Valid:** `cpt-363-1`, `course-1`, `course-section-2`  
**Invalid:** `01.course` (starts with a digit), `course` (no number), `1course` (starts with a digit)

## Requirements

- Grav CMS >= 1.7.0
- [Grav Premium Helios Theme](https://getgrav.org/premium/helios) – your purchase directly supports ongoing development of the open-source Grav CMS
- Shortcode Core plugin >= 5.0.0
